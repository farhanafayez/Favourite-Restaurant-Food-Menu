# Favourite-Restaurant-Food-Menu

A django app, that lets users login and create a list of their favourite restaurants, along with their location and what kind of cuisine it offers. Users are also able to add items that the like, and exclude items that they dislike, in particular a dish.

The app mainly focuses on the functionality and backend part of the app, it does not include any fancy user interface yet.

The app is in a heroku server.
